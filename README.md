# FairPlay - Share your sports activities !

## O'Clock end of training project.

We had a month to make a website from A to Z.

FairPlay web applications allows users to search, filter, organize and share sports activities around their geographic locations.

After the project end I reviewed the front-end part and I keep developing some optimizations and features to increase my JS and React skills.

## Our team was composed of 4 people :

- Boris as Lead Dev and Design
- Benjamin as Lead Front
- Clotilde as Product Owner
- Jeremy as Scrum Master

## Stack :

- React and Redux for front interface and state management
- Node.js using Express.js for back-end with a PostgreSQL database

Demo deployed on GCP E2 instance :

You can test all functionalities, create an account, an activity, register ... :)
